RB-CLUB-BOT is a simple discord bot that takes club meet attendance (optional) and assigns players to courts as well players to compete against
This works only for singles games (for now)

To use the bot in the server, navigate to the "game-assignment" text channel and use the following commands
!create (admin)
!join-code
!end (admin)
!assign (admin)
!shuffle (admin)
!manual-name (admin)
!show
!help

Only admins (club officers) have the ability to manipulate and change the current meet properties
Players can join with a code provided by the one who created the meet instance
